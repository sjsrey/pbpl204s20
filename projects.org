* Project Description
The course project provides and opportunity to blend your newly acquired
computational skills with the theories, methods, and models of regional
analysis. Beginning in week five of the quarter, we will dedicate the second
weekly meeting to project studies where we collaborate on moving your projects
forward.
* Requirements
- Projects must be approved by the instructor by April 20
- Project code must be fully documented and available on a github repository
- Your final project will be based on the state of the master branch on June 11
* Grading
